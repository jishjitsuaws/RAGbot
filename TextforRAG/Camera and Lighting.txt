#### **4.3 Close-Up (CU)**
- A tight shot focusing on the subject’s face.

### **5. Cinematic Composition Techniques**

#### **5.1 Rule of Thirds**
- The frame is divided into nine equal parts.
- Placing key elements along these lines creates balance and visual interest.

#### **5.2 Leading Lines**
- Natural lines within the composition (roads, fences, shadows) guide the viewer’s eye toward the subject.

#### **5.3 Depth of Field**
- **Shallow Depth of Field:** Subject is in sharp focus, background blurred.
- **Deep Depth of Field:** Everything in the frame remains in focus.

#### **5.4 Negative Space**
- Using empty space around a subject emphasizes isolation or contrast.

#### **5.5 Foreground, Midground, and Background**
- Layering subjects within a frame creates depth and a three-dimensional feel.
